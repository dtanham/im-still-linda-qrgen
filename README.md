# im-still-linda-qrgen
A QR code generator for the Leeds #homelesshack app **"I'm still Linda"**.


# I'm still Linda

**I'm still Linda** aims to do three things:

* Provide a way for homeless people to identify themselves to trusted organisations without having to tell their life story each time
* Provide a way for those organisations to permissively share information and intelligence about their clients to more effectively target their services
* Provide a way of supporting sharing of anonymous data at regional and national level

Exemplar services:

* Overnight hostel
* Addiction management centre

_As a requirement of staying at St George's Crypt, Dave needs to attend the addiction management clinic in York Street. He uses his Service Pass QR code to identify himself at both centres. York St keep his record up to date to show that he has been keeping his appointments. St George's Crypt can use the QR code to check that Dave has been keeping his commitment._

# About this service

This service generates a QR code for use by the main service. It uses the accessible [Open Dyslexic font](https://opendyslexic.org) to render words that can be used/memorised in place of the QR code.

The code itself should be used to provide a URL to an authenticated service that service providers (eg hostels) can use to identify their clients.
